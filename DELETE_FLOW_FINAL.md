# Delete Account - Final Fix for Foreign Key Issues

## 🐛 **Previous Issue:**
```
Auth deletion failed: update or delete on table "users" violates foreign key constraint "user_profiles_id_fkey" on table "user_profiles"
```

## ✅ **Final Solution - Correct Deletion Order:**

### **Frontend (Settings.tsx):**
1. **Deletes data tables** (analyses, resumes, rewrite_history, user_settings)
2. **Calls backend** to handle auth user and profile deletion
3. **Backend handles** profile deletion properly

### **Backend (subscription.py):**
1. **Gets Stripe customer ID** from profile before deletion
2. **Deletes Stripe customer** (with 404 error handling)
3. **Deletes user_profiles** table record first
4. **Deletes auth user** (no more FK constraint conflict)
5. **Handles failures** gracefully

## 🎯 **Expected Server Logs Now:**

```
Deleting user account: 3458cdf9-50d5-48d8-855e-7b94a571febb
Found Stripe customer to delete: cus_SuqAFKJVLArIu6
Successfully deleted Stripe customer: cus_SuqAFKJVLArIu6
Successfully deleted user profile: 3458cdf9-50d5-48d8-855e-7b94a571febb
should_soft_delete parameter not supported, using regular delete
Successfully deleted user from auth (email may have delay): 3458cdf9-50d5-48d8-855e-7b94a571febb
```

## 🔄 **New Deletion Flow:**

```
Frontend: Clear Data Tables
    ↓
Backend: Get Stripe Customer ID
    ↓
Backend: Delete Stripe Customer
    ↓
Backend: Delete user_profiles Record  ← (KEY FIX: Delete profile first)
    ↓
Backend: Delete Auth User  ← (No more FK constraint)
    ↓
Frontend: Sign Out & Redirect
```

## 🛡️ **Error Handling:**

### **If Stripe Deletion Fails:**
- Continues with profile and auth deletion
- Logs the Stripe error but doesn't stop process

### **If Profile Deletion Fails:**
- Continues with auth deletion
- May still hit FK constraint, but that's logged

### **If Auth Deletion Fails:**
- Profile is already deleted (main data cleanup done)
- User data is cleaned up even if auth record remains

## 🧪 **Test the Fix:**

1. **Delete an account** and watch server logs
2. **Should see**: Profile deleted BEFORE auth user deletion
3. **No more**: FK constraint violation errors
4. **Result**: Complete account removal from all systems

## 🎯 **What Should Work Now:**

✅ **Complete deletion** without FK errors  
✅ **Stripe customer cleanup**  
✅ **User profile removal**  
✅ **Auth user deletion**  
✅ **Graceful error handling**  
✅ **Proper user feedback**  

## 🚀 **Ready for Testing:**

The delete account flow should now work completely without foreign key constraint errors. The key was ensuring the **profile is deleted before the auth user**, not after or at the same time.

**Try deleting an account now - should see clean logs without any FK constraint violations!** 🎉
