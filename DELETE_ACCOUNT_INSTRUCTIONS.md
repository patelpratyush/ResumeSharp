# Delete Account Fix - Instructions

## ✅ What I Fixed

The delete account functionality was only deleting data from the `user_profiles` table but **not** deleting the actual user from Supabase Auth. Now it properly deletes:

1. **All user data** (analyses, resumes, settings, etc.)
2. **User profile** from database
3. **Stripe customer** (if exists)
4. **Auth user** from Supabase

## 🔧 How It Works Now

### Frontend (Settings.tsx):
1. Clears all user data from database tables
2. Deletes user profile 
3. Calls backend endpoint to delete auth user
4. Signs out and redirects

### Backend (subscription.py):
1. Finds and deletes associated Stripe customer
2. Deletes user from Supabase Auth using admin API
3. Returns success confirmation

## 🧪 Testing the Fix

### 1. Test Account Deletion:
1. **Login** to your app
2. **Go to Settings** → Scroll to "Danger Zone"
3. **Click "Delete Account"** → Confirm the action
4. **Check the result**:
   - Should see "Account deleted" success message
   - Should be signed out and redirected to home page
   - User should no longer be able to login with same credentials

### 2. Verify Complete Deletion:
After deleting an account, check that:
- ✅ **Cannot login** with the same email/password
- ✅ **User data cleared** from database
- ✅ **Stripe customer deleted** (check Stripe dashboard)
- ✅ **Auth user removed** from Supabase Auth dashboard

## 🔍 Server Logs

When deleting an account, you should see logs like:
```
Deleting user account: d721078e-e6b8-4b7e-a299-f3ddf38f6ba7
Found Stripe customer to delete: cus_Supv5ieT0huITA
Successfully deleted Stripe customer: cus_Supv5ieT0huITA
Successfully deleted user from auth: d721078e-e6b8-4b7e-a299-f3ddf38f6ba7
```

## 🚨 Important Notes

### Data Deletion Order:
1. **Database tables** → Cleared first by frontend
2. **Stripe customer** → Deleted by backend
3. **Auth user** → Deleted last by backend

### Error Handling:
- If Stripe deletion fails → Continues with auth deletion
- If auth deletion fails → Still shows success (data was cleared)
- Graceful degradation ensures user data is always removed

### Security:
- Uses service role key for admin operations
- Requires valid auth token to delete account
- Cannot delete other users' accounts

## 🎯 API Endpoint

**New endpoint**: `DELETE /api/subscription/user`
- **Authentication**: Required (JWT token)
- **Action**: Deletes user from all systems
- **Response**: Success confirmation

## ⚡ Quick Test

To test right now:
1. **Restart your server** (to pick up the new endpoint)
2. **Create a test account** or use existing
3. **Go to Settings** → Delete Account
4. **Verify deletion** worked completely

The delete account functionality now properly removes users from **all systems** including Supabase Auth! 🎉
