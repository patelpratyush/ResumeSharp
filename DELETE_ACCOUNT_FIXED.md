# Delete Account - Foreign Key Issue Fixed

## 🐛 **Issues Found & Fixed:**

### 1. **Foreign Key Constraint Violation:**
- **Problem**: Frontend deleted `user_profiles` first, then backend tried to delete auth user
- **Error**: `violates foreign key constraint "user_profiles_id_fkey"`
- **Fix**: Backend now deletes auth user first (which cascades to profile) or handles manual cleanup

### 2. **Missing Stripe Customer Handling:**
- **Problem**: Tried to delete Stripe customer that didn't exist (404 error)
- **Fix**: Added proper error handling for missing customers

## ✅ **New Deletion Flow:**

### **Frontend:**
1. **Clears data tables** (analyses, resumes, settings) - non-FK tables first
2. **Calls backend endpoint** to handle auth user and profile deletion
3. **Signs out and redirects** to home page

### **Backend:**
1. **Gets Stripe customer ID** from profile (before deletion)
2. **Deletes Stripe customer** (with 404 error handling)
3. **Deletes auth user** (this cascades to user_profiles due to FK)
4. **Manual cleanup** if auth deletion fails

## 🔧 **Technical Improvements:**

### **Better Error Handling:**
```python
# Handles missing Stripe customers gracefully
except stripe.error.InvalidRequestError as stripe_error:
    if "No such customer" in str(stripe_error):
        print(f"Stripe customer already deleted: {stripe_customer_id}")
```

### **Proper Deletion Order:**
```python
# 1. Get customer ID before deletion
# 2. Delete Stripe customer 
# 3. Delete auth user (cascades to profile)
# 4. Manual cleanup if needed
```

### **Cascade vs Manual:**
- **Primary**: Auth deletion cascades to profile (FK constraint)
- **Fallback**: Manual profile deletion if auth fails

## 🧪 **Testing the Fix:**

### **Expected Server Logs:**
```
Deleting user account: [user-id]
Found Stripe customer to delete: cus_xxxxx
Stripe customer already deleted or doesn't exist: cus_xxxxx  [if 404]
Successfully deleted user from auth (and cascaded profile): [user-id]
```

### **Test Steps:**
1. **Create test account** (sign up)
2. **Use the app** (create some data)
3. **Go to Settings** → Danger Zone → Delete Account
4. **Confirm deletion**
5. **Verify complete removal:**
   - ✅ Cannot login with same credentials
   - ✅ User not in Supabase Auth dashboard
   - ✅ User profile removed from database
   - ✅ All user data cleared

## 🎯 **What Should Happen Now:**

### **Success Flow:**
```
1. Frontend clears data tables
2. Backend deletes Stripe customer (if exists)
3. Backend deletes auth user → cascades to profile
4. User signed out and redirected
5. Account completely removed from all systems
```

### **Error Handling:**
- **Stripe 404**: Continues (customer already gone)
- **Auth deletion fails**: Manual profile cleanup attempted
- **All fails**: Shows error to user, account may be partially deleted

## 🚨 **Production Ready:**

The delete account now properly handles:
- ✅ **Foreign key constraints**
- ✅ **Missing Stripe customers**  
- ✅ **Cascade deletion from auth**
- ✅ **Manual cleanup fallbacks**
- ✅ **Proper error reporting**

## 🎉 **Quick Test:**

**Try deleting an account now - should see logs like:**
```
Deleting user account: [id]
Found Stripe customer to delete: [customer-id]
Stripe customer already deleted or doesn't exist: [customer-id]
Successfully deleted user from auth (and cascaded profile): [id]
```

**And the account should be completely removed from all systems!** ✨
